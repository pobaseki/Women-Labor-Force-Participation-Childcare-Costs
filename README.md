Problem Identification
The rising cost of childcare has become a significant financial burden for many families in the United States. This issue disproportionately affects families from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, potentially limiting their access to quality childcare and impacting their economic stability. The problem is exacerbated by regional disparities in childcare costs and the varying availability of affordable childcare options.
Introduction to Problem 
According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the cost of daycare has risen roughly 36%, outpacing the rise in inflation during that time. According to the Care.com 2024 Cost of Care Report, families are using both their savings and their household income to meet the cost of child care which is becoming a large expense. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) states that child care is considered affordable when it costs families no more than 7% of their household income. Yet, on average, according to the Care survey, respondents are spending 24% of their household income on child care (vs. 27% in the prior year), with 60% spending 20% or more and (as compared to 67% last year) and 84% spending 10% or more (compared to 89% last year).  
Because of the expiration of a pandemic-era safety net that helped stabilize the childcare industry across the US, A new Care.com survey of US adults who pay for professional childcare found that a majority of respondents expect their childcare costs to increase by $7,000 this year, or $600 or more per month. Finding and affording child care has long been a challenge for families, but the child care cliff has only exacerbated the situation, and families are already feeling the impact.he child care cliff is the term used to describe the abrupt end to pandemic-era funding that kept thousands of child care programs afloat nationwide. The $24 billion was allocated to aid child care programs in covering basic operational costs, program materials, wages and benefits. Expiration of the funding at the end of September 2023 has set the stage for a devastating loss of child care jobs and spots. In fact, The Century Foundation reports that 70,000 child care providers could be impacted and suffer consequences ranging from closures to shrinking enrollments to increased fees. According to the Care survey to be able to aford child care, families are making major sacrifices to afford quality care such as Working multiple jobs (28%) Reducing hours at work (27%). Moving closer to family (25%) Going into debt (19%). Leaving the workforce (17%).
Challenges of Unaffordable Childcare - The primary challenge addressed in this field is the lack of affordable childcare options, which significantly impacts economic mobility and workforce participation. Understanding the factors driving childcare costs and identifying areas where policy interventions can make a difference is crucial for creating equitable solutions. This project aims to fill a gap in the existing research by providing a detailed socioeconomic analysis of childcare prices and their implications for different demographic groups.
Analytic Gaps- Lack of comprehensive studies that analyze the intersection of childcare costs with various socioeconomic factors such as income levels, geographic regions, and care settings
Hypothesis - Childcare costs are significantly influenced by socioeconomic factors such as household income, geographic location, and the type of care setting. These factors create disparities in access to affordable childcare, impacting families' economic stability and workforce participation.
What does this hypothesis translate to mathematically
Classification: To categorize regions or demographic groups based on the affordability of childcare.
Regression: To predict childcare costs based on various socioeconomic factors.
Pattern Recognition: To identify trends and patterns in childcare costs across different regions and demographic groups.
Intended Data â€“ Childcare prices by age dataset
Approach
Data Collection, Data Cleansing, Exploratory Data Analysis, Model Building, Conclusion
